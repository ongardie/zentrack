 * This is a base class to allow for retrieving lists of various things.  Several primary purposes
 * exist for this class: 
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Abstraction of redundant code for obtaining lists
 *  <li>Standardization of search procedures
 *  <li>(hopefully)get enough info in results to avoid producing a seperate object for each item
 *  <li>Provide methods for sorting results on the fly
 *  <li>Allow for possible serialization and passing between pages (reducing system load considerably)
 * </ol>
 *
 * This class should not be called, rather, it should be extended and used
 * by a child class.
 *
 * All child classes must define the DbQuery object in their constructor, specifying
 * the tables to be used, and preparing this class for use
