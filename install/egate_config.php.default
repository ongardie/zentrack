   * STRIP ORIGINAL MESSAGE FROM REPLIES.
   *
   * This is primarily for Outlook, which does not prefix quoted text in emails, so
   * we use this to match a prefix outlook puts before the replied-to text.
   *
   * It removes text from emails based on a regexp. You can literally use
   * this to remove anything from the email. The intention, of course,
   * being to delete the quoted reply text only.
   *
   * The default setting is to replace any text after the tag
   * ---Original Message--- (surrounded by 3 or more dashes)
   *
   * This is a PHP regular expression. Note the .* at the end, this causes it to delete everything
   * from the regexp to the end of the message. Also note the "s" modifier
   * after the the closing bar. This causes the .* to match \n (returns)
   * which would otherwise be excluded and allows it to reach the end of the
   * message instead of just the end of the line.
   *
   * To add multiple bits of text, use the (...|...) notation, like this:
   * "@\n\s*(-{3,}Original Message-{3,}|[*]{2,}Reply from [^*]+[*]{2,}).*$@s"
   *
   * The above example would match ---Original Message--- or ** Reply from name here **
   *
   * To disable this feature, simply set this variable to false.
