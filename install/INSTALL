 SECURITY

  In a unix environment, to improve system security, log in as super user and run 
      
    zen.php -extra_secure_mode apache_user apache_group

    ..apache_user - the user your apache process runs as (nobody)
    ..apache_group - the group your apache process runs as (nobody)

  You must be the super user to run this.  You must know the user
  and group of you server to accomplish this.

  This will set the directory permissions to the most strict applicable.

  To return them to a relaxed state, run

     install.php -check_permissions

  Note that you must run the extra_secure_mode after each upgrade to ensure compliance
