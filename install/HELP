  Running CLI Scripts (the install script)
   
    If you have trouble running the install script on windows, try prefixing
    your command with the location of the CLI executable, for instance:
       c:\php\cli\php.exe install.php -test_db_connection

    If you have trouble on unix, try editing the #!/ statement in the first
    line of the install.php script to point to your cli executable.

    If the script complains ""You must use the CLI(command line) binary ...."
    this means that you are not using a CLI compatable binary.  Try running
    php -v to see what version you have.  You may have an alternate binary
    in your php install directory (under cli/) which you can use.  If not,
    you will need to compile one (you may compile both a CLI and CGI/sapi
    version on the same box, just be careful where you output the binary
    to (i.e. don't overwrite one with the other)
	
  Debugging

    Open up your includes/config/debug.xml file and set <root level="3" />
    This will produce debugging output.  Check the settings in your zen.ini
    file to see where this output is going.


  Support

   CRITICAL!!  When submitting a support request, always begin by turning 
	on your debug output and copy/paste the output, or attaching 
        the contents of your logs/debug_log.txt file to the support request!
