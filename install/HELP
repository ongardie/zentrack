  Debugging

    Open up your includes/config/debug.xml file and set <root level="3" />
    This will produce debugging output.  Check the settings in your zen.ini
    file to see where this output is going.


  Support

   CRITICAL!!  When submitting a support request, always begin by turning 
	on your debug output and copy/paste the output, or attaching 
        the contents of your logs/debug_log.txt file to the support request!
           

    mailing list - zentrack-users is a great place to get help.  Answers usually
             within an hour.  http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=22724, never
             ignored.

    project - http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/zentrack (see the support pages)
             (This will get you a response, probably in hours, maybe in days, but
             you will get one)

    irc    - zentrack now has a home on irc.sourceforge.net, #zentrack, this may
             be a good place to find some help with more in depth issues.
             (usually a response in minutes, sometimes ignored)
