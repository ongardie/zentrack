 INSTALLATION

   2. CVS CHECKOUTS ONLY: Run install.php --makeini (if there is no zen.ini file)
   3. Edit the zen.ini file to meet your system needs
   4. Run install.php -try_db_connection (if desired)

 SECURITY (experimental)

  In a unix environment, to improve system security, you can run -extra_secure_mode.
  This will change permissions on all directories to the most secure setting.  Note
  that you should do this only after completing your setup.

  Log in as super user and run:
      
    install.php -extra_secure_mode apache_user apache_group

    apache_user - the user your apache process runs as (nobody|apache)
    apache_group - the group your apache process runs as (nobody|apache)

  You must be the super user to run this.  You must know the user
  and group of you server to accomplish this.

  This will set the directory permissions to the most strict applicable.

  To return them to a relaxed state, run

     install.php -check_permissions

  Note that you must run the extra_secure_mode after each upgrade to ensure compliance

  Note also that you must relax permissions again before you will be able
  to make edits and changes to your setup.
