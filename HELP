  Troubleshooting:
        Open includes/configVars.php and set $this->debug = 3;  This will produce
        Highly useful output for debugging.  If you have trouble, send a support
        request (see below) with the debug output pasted at the bottom of your message.

  Support

    CRITICAL!!  When submitting a support request, always begin by setting 
                $this->debug = 3; in the includes/configVars.php file and then
		pasting the results in the request.  If you can't get zenTrack to
		run this far, THEN YOU MUST SUBMIT YOUR VERSION INFO for zenTrack,
		your OS, your Browser, and your Server, so that we can re-create
		the error.
           

    online - http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/zentrack (see the support pages)
             (This will get you a response, probably in hours, maybe in days, but
              you will get one)

    irc    - zentrack now has a home on irc.sourceforge.net, #zentrack, this may
   	     be a good place to find some help with more in depth issues.

             within an hour.  http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=22724, never
             ignored.
