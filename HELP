  TROUBLESHOOTING
  --------------------------------------------
     Insure that you do not use \ characters for directories in your header.php file!
     
    Open includes/configVars.php and set $this->debug = 1,2, or 3;  
    This will produce highly useful output for debugging.  
    If you have trouble, send a support request (see below) with 
    the debug output pasted at the bottom of your message.

  --------------------------------------------
  SUPPORT
  --------------------------------------------

    CRITICAL!!  When submitting a support request, always begin by setting 
                $Debug_Mode = 3; in the www/header.php file and then pasting the
                results in the request.  If you can't get zenTrack to run this
                far, THEN YOU MUST SUBMIT YOUR VERSION INFO for zenTrack, your OS,
                your Browser, and your Server, so that we can re-create the error.

  COMMON ERRORS
  --------------------------------------------

  HEADER.PHP MISSING
    -This is probably a cvs checkout.  Just go to the directory where
     you unzipped zentrack and run setup_from_cvs (.cmd on windows) to
     build directories, permissions, and the header.php file.

  LOGIN PROBLEMS
    -Logins are case sensitive

    -Check your database and insure there are entries in the ZENTRACK_USERS
     table.

    -The Administrator password is Administrator, User password is User, Guest
     password is Guest.

    -Sessions have to be working properly, cookies enabled

    -The url you type in your browser must match the domain the server thinks it is, or session may fail.

  REPORT IMAGE PROBLEMS
    -Broken images
      You must have GD 2.0 and freetype installed
      You can view error messages by right clicking on the broken image, and getting the direct url
      When you browse to this url, you will see the error output (possibly the image binary too)

    -To view debugging output for an image, open www/view_image.php and setting $graph->debug to 1-3.
      You will probably want to use 1 or 2, 3 is mostly for developers
      Note that you have to view the image directly to see this (in the page, it just shows a broken image)

    -Problems viewing png images

    You can manually set the image type to "jpeg" if you have
    trouble with pngs by opening includes/reportConfig.php
    and finding the line called image_type.

  EMAIL GATEWAY PROBLEMS
    -Check includes/logs/egate_log for clues
    
    -Make sure you have the egate user account set up with proper permissions 
       (this account doesn't have to be active)
       
    -Make sure you turn on email_gateway in the configuration panel.

    -Make sure that you have your egate scripts chmod to 755 (executable)

  OTHER DATABASE USERS
    -We can support, upon request, DB2, Sybase, or other
     install scripts, with some assistance from you.
