  Troubleshooting:
        Open includes/configVars.php and set $this->debug = 1,2, or 3;  
        This will produce highly useful output for debugging.  
        If you have trouble, send a support request (see below) with 
        the debug output pasted at the bottom of your message.

  Support

    CRITICAL!!  When submitting a support request, always begin by setting 
                $Debug_Mode = 3; in the www/header.php file and then pasting the
                results in the request.  If you can't get zenTrack to run this
                far, THEN YOU MUST SUBMIT YOUR VERSION INFO for zenTrack, your OS,
                your Browser, and your Server, so that we can re-create the error.
