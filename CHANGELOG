----- CHANGE LOG FORMAT ------
The version should appear with dashes and indicated in the example, above all corresponding entries. 

The username, and date should appear before any entry 

The update comments should appear just after this. 

A list of files changed, and the new version should be included with dashes under the comments. This can be used by other developers to quick-reference what has changed, and the versions to diff in CVS to find the changes.. for testing and bug tracking. 

To obtain a quick list of files you changed, use this command: cvs history -D 03/12/2003 -c 

There is also a perl script which you can obtain from one of the developers which will parse the output of that command into nicely formatted rows to cut and paste here.

Example 

----- Vx.x.y ------

yyyy-mm-dd, YourName
  Your comments about the update, indented 2 spaces, it can be
  multiple lines and very long, and should be kept to about this
  with, which is around 60-80 columns
