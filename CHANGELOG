 zenTrack is a top quality, simple, and elegant 
 tracking system for small to medium-large companies.
 Clean, simple interface, fully adaptable administration,
 100 percent object oriented and database abstracted. 

----- this version -----

Added feature to display "all users" for the user admin screen.

Fixed bug with creating new users that caused their access level to
be set to null instead of the value entered.

Added title to the heading of the page for ticket and project views.

Added the "note" type to the ticket types.  This type will auto-close
when created, preventing the need for a user to close it.  Thus, it 
is stored only for documentation.

Changed "password" to "passphrase" for Sybase compatibility.

Fixed $rootUrl issues with url_ticket_view and url_attachment_view

Fixed some issues with the "view all users" function in user admin

Fixed issue with the "first login" so that it will make users
change their passphrase from the default before they can continue

Comments added to configVars.php section to indicate
better use of Oracle/adodb methods

setenv() functions added for locale related issues, and for oracle
fixes


----- v2.0.1c beta (05-01-02) ------

All upper case column names changed to lower case 
entries for oracle/adodb compatibility

Fixed bug in new project form concerning the start date.

----- v2.0.1 Beta (04-27-02) ------
  
Oracle issue with uppercase column names (hopefully) overcome 
with use of the ADODB function "oci8po"

Fix for ONAMES and HOSTNAMES provided by Izzy (thanks Izzy!)
  
Oracle build files tested and repaired.  Several bugs with
reserved words and escape characters removed.

configVars.php and header.php files cleaned up, and better
commented.
