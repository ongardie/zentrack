UPGRADE FROM 2.5.0.2
--------------------
  
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  !!! VERY IMPORTANT NOTE !!!
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  
  As of 2.5.0.3, there are now two ways to upgrade.  There
  is a patch and a manual upgrade approach.  Please select
  the method that meets your needs.

  QUICK UPGRADE:
  --------------
    
    IMPORTANT:  If you are not comfortable with patches, and you have any love for your current
    installation, might I recommend the manual install?  Patches are not trivial if they do
    not go as expected.
    
    -> Windows Users:  Unless you have and understand cygwin, use the manual upgrade.
    -> '/web/zentrack' refers to your current ZT installation
    -> '/tmp/zentrack_2.5.5' refers to your newly uncompressed install files. 
    
    1. Make backups of your files and database by whatever means you see fit:
       (perhaps 'mysqldump zentrack > db_backup.sql' and 'tar -zcvf file_backup.tar.gz /web/zentrack')

    2. Apply the patch:
       cd /web/zentrack
       patch --dry-run -p2 < /tmp/zentrack_2.5.5/install/2-5-0-2_upgrade.patch (test it first)
       patch -p2 < /tmp/zentrack_2.5.5/install/2-5-0-2_upgrade.patch

    3. Upgrade database:
       Run the sql file install/UPGRADE_[yourdb].sql file using your favorite
       sql interface (you may also open the file and run the statements directly if
       this is easier for you).

    4. See 'After Upgrade' below

    ?. If you modified the directory structure during your installion (renamed or moved
       your www/ or includes/ folders) you can make the patch work by simulating this structure:

        For instance, if your directory structure looks like this:
          /web/my_website/htdocs/zt (location of my www/ folder)
          /usr/lib/zentrack/zt_includes (location of my includes/ folder)

        Then you could use these links to make the patch work as expected:
          mkdir /tmp/zentrack
          ln -s /web/my_website/htdocs/zt /tmp/zentrack/www
          ln -s /usr/lib/zentrack/zt_includes /tmp/zentrack/includes

        Then run your patch as follows:
          cd /tmp/zentrack
          patch --dry-run -p2 < /tmp/zentrack_2.5.0.3/install/2-5-0-3_upgrade.patch (test it first)
          patch -p2 < /tmp/zentrack_2.5.0.3/install/2-5-0-3_upgrade.patch
    

  MANUAL UPGRADE:
  ---------------

    -> Update includes/egate_config.php manually, it has changed, do not copy your old config file!

    1. Make backups of your files and database by whatever means you see fit:
       (perhaps 'mysqldump zentrack > db_backup.sql' and 'tar -zcvf file_backup.tar.gz /web/zentrack')

    2. Overwrite old files:

        Replace your zentrack directory structure with the included files: 
          includes/ should overwrite your existing includes,
          www/ should overwrite your existing www/

    3. Set directory permissions (probably only necessary on unix)

        chmod 777 includes/attachments (if using attachments)
        chmod 777 includes/logs
        chmod 777 includes/cache
        chmod 777 includes/translations
        chmod 755 includes/egate.php
        chmod 755 includes/egate_create.php 

    4. Upgrade your database:
       Run the sql file install/UPGRADE_[yourdb].sql file using your favorite
       sql interface (you may also open the file and run the statements directly if
       this is easier for you).

  AFTER UPGRADE:
  --------------

    Speak Up!
       Let us know you are using zentrack, meet other users, 
       and send us feedback on your install: http://www.zentrack.net

    Consider a donation to the Open Source Community:
       The developers spend a lot of their lives developing this product.  If you like it,
       give something back to the open source community!  Might I recomment starting here:

--------------------
UPGRADE FROM 2.5.0.1
--------------------

  You must update header.php manually, you may not copy over your old
  header.php file!

  Run the sql file install/previous/2.5.0.2.UPGRADE_[yourdb].sql file using your favorite
  sql interface (you can open the file and run the statements directly if
  this is easier for you).  This will upgrade you to 2.5.0.2 database.

  Follow instructions for 2.5.0.2
 
--------------------
UPGRADE FROM 2.5.0
--------------------

  Follow instructions for 2.5.0.1 

  (2.5.0.1 contains only bug fixes from version 2.5.0, they are essentially the same)

--------------------
UPGRADE FROM 2.4.4
--------------------

  REPLACE Your entire zentrack directory structure with the
  included files: includes/ should overwrite your existing includes,
  www/ should overwrite your existing www/

  Set directory permissions (probably only necessary on unix)
     -chmod 777 includes/attachments (if using attachments)
     -chmod 777 includes/logs
     -chmod 777 includes/cache
     -chmod 777 includes/translations
     -chmod 755 includes/egate.php
     -chmod 755 includes/egate_create.php  

  Run the sql file install/previous/2.5.0.1.UPGRADE_[yourdb].sql file using your favorite
  sql interface (you can open the file and run the statements directly if
  this is easier for you).  This will upgrade you to the 2.5.0.1 database (the database
  version between 2.5.0 and 2.5.0.1 are identical).

  Follow install instructions for 2.5.0  
  
--------------------
UPGRADE FROM 2.4.3
--------------------
  
  Follow install instructions for 2.4.4

  (Because there are no database changes between 2.4.3 and 2.4.4, the
  install procedure for 2.4.3 is exactly the same as 2.4.4.)

--------------------
UPGRADE FROM 2.4.2
--------------------

  IMPORTANT USAGE NOTE:
    The ability to create new projects is now controlled by a separate access level
    than ticket creation, see level_create and level_create_proj in the admin->config menu
    for more details

  Run the sql file install/previous/2.4.3.UPGRADE_[yourdb].sql file using your favorite
  sql interface (you can open the file and run the statements directly if
  this is easier for you).  This will upgrade you to 2.4.3 database.

  Follow upgrade instructions for version 2.4.3

--------------------
UPGRADE FROM EALIER THAN 2.4.2
