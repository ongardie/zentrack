  QUICK INSTALL STEPS

    - Differences from previous versions
	* There is no longer a need to modify includes/configVars.php
	* This code should work as is with PHP 4.2.x, no register_globals 
	    problems
	* There are several additions to the DB, but they shouldn't harm
	    your existing content
    - Setting up the code
	* Make a backup of your includes/configVars.php and www/header.php files
	* Backup any modifications you have made to the code
	* Replace your existing code with the new install code
	    It's probably a good idea to move the existing install
	    to a .old directory and keep it for a bit.. then place the
	    new code in the vacant directory
    - Configuring zenTrack
	* Modify the www/header.php file to reflect your database and system 
            settings.  Many of the things you found previously in configVars 
            are either here, or moved into the database.	
    - Modifying your database
	* It's a good idea to make a dump of your data first... although you 
	    will most likely be just fine
	* Create a filespace(instance) on your database and create/assign a 
	    user access permissions to this DB
	* Find the script called installs/Upgrade.your_db_type and load this
	    script into your SQL interface
	* Open your web browser, browse to admin->Configuration Settings, and 
	    configure the new settings to your taste.
