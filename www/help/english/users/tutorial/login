<p><b>Changing Your Password</b></p>
  
<p>Initially, when you log in, you will probably see the change password screen.
This will allow you to change your password to something you can remember.

<p>You may see some instructions to help you create a valid password. 

<p>This is an optional feature to make it harder for others to guess your password, and
you will not be allowed to enter anything which does not conform to this
requirement (if enabled).
