<p align='center' class='bigbold'>Ownership of Tickets</p>

<p>Most of the actions you will take to modify or complete a ticket can
only be performed by the owner.  There are several ways to gain ownership:
<ul>
  <li>It can be assigned to you when it is created
  <li>A manager can assign it to you
  <li>You can accept it (if allowed by your administrator)
  <li>Managers can also take away ownership if needed using the '<?=tr("Yank")?>' feature.
</ul>

<p>Some actions can be performed by a supervisor, even if they are not the owner
 (such as moving the ticket to a new bin or closing the ticket).  Other actions
 can be performed by anyone, not just the owner (such as creating log entries).

<p>Accepting a ticket is done simply by clicking on the '<?=tr("Accept")?>' button in
the ticket view.

<p>Assigning a ticket requires higher access rights than accepting, and is
performed by clicking on the '<?=tr('Assign')?>' button in the ticket view.
