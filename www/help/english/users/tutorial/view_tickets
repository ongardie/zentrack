<p><b>Finding a Ticket</b></p>

<p>By clicking on the '<?=tr("Tickets")?>' link in the nav bar to the left, you can
bring up the list of current items.  This will also expand the left-hand menu
to include some advanced features, such as creating tickets and viewing items
which are only assigned to you.

<p>This will bring up the list of tickets (shown below), which you can use to
select a ticket.  There may be multiple pages, which will be noted by the 
next/previous links and page numbers at the bottom right.

<p>You can also search for tickets if you aren't sure what you are looking for
by going to the '<?=tr("Search")?>' link on the left-hand menu.  We won't discuss
that feature in this tutorial, but it is worth mentioning.

<p><b>Filtering the List</b></p>

<p>Select the link to only view tickets which are assigned to you will remove
any tickets from the list on the right which do not list you as the current
owner.

<p>You can also filter the list of tickets using the '<?=tr("Current Bin")?>' pulldown
in the navigation menu.  This will reduce the list to show only the tickets which
are within the <?=tr("Bin")?> you have picked.

<p>A Bin is a way to group tickets.  Some companies use a <?=tr("Bins")?> to describe
departments or teams.  Others use the bin to group tickets according to customers
or types of customers.  You will have to decide within your organization what
the groups will be.

<p>Alternately, if you know the id of a particular ticket, you can bring it
up quickly by typing the id into the box at the top right of the 
screen and hitting enter.

<p><b>Making Sense of the Ticket View</b></p>

<p>Once you have selected a ticket, you will be presented with the ticket view.
This screen contains several important elements: 

<ul>
  <b>(1)</b> Critical information about the ticket
  <br><b>(2)</b> the actions which you may take to alter the ticket 
    (these may be enabled or disabled based on the condition of the ticket)
  <br><b>(3)</b> tabs containing more components of the ticket such as
  the details, log, attachments, and system messages
</ul>

<p>This screen is where you will conduct most of your work regarding a ticket.
We will discuss this more as the tutorial continues.
