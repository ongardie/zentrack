<p align='center' class='bigbold'>The Ticket Log</p>

<p><b>Purpose</b></p>

<p>The log is where notes, information, and labor are recorded for
tickets.  

<p>This screen is updated whenever the status of the ticket changes
with the time, user, and action performed as well as any time worked and comments
by the user.

<p><b>How to View</b></p>

<p>You can view the existing log entries for a ticket by browsing to it and
then by opening the 'Log' tab in the ticket view.</p>

<p>Anyone with access to view the bin where the ticket is located can view
the log as well.

<p><b>Creating Log Entries</b></p>

<p>You can create a log entry (assuming you have sufficient access) by clicking
on the '<?=tr('Log')?>' button in the ticket view.

<p>Code or text you enter will be preserved in format and spacing.  When you place <b>hyperlinks</b>(web urls, such as www.yahoo.com) into the
log, they will become active links that users can click to view that page.
