  <span class="bigBold">The Quick Install Procedure:</span>

  <p><b>Obtain and Install zenTrack Files</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/zentrack/">Download</a> the latest
  version of zenTrack from source forge.
    <li>Untar the files.
    <ul>
      <li>On windows: Use winzip and extract them to a folder</li>
      <li>On Unix:  use tar -zxvf [zentrack filename].tar.gz from the command prompt</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Move the files to the directory where they will be used.
    <ul>
      <li><b>The www/ directory belongs in the public_html tree.</b>  This folder can be renamed and moved as you desire.
      <li><b>THE INCLUDES/ DIRECTORY BELONGS OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC_HTML TREE</b>
        <br>(where these pages cannot be called directly, this folder can be renamed and moved as you desire)
      <li>The includes/misc folder contains all of the install/build/setup instructions you will need.</li>      
    </ul>
    <li>Chmod the www/ and includes/ directories, and all of their contents to 755.
    <li>Set the owner of these directories and files to a secure user
    <li>Chmod the includes/attachments directory to 666 (or 766 if you're religious)

  <p><b>Configure zenTrack</b></p>
    <li>Open the www/header.php file and change the $rootUrl and $libDir to match your system.  Change any other variables here to match your preferences.
    <li>Open the includes/configVars.php file and change the parameters to match your database and preferences.
  </ul>

  <p><b>Build an Seed Database</b></p>  
  <ul>
    <li>Create a new database instance to be used by zenTrack and create a user login with 
        appropriate permissions.
    <li>In includes/misc, run the build.sql file that matches your database type as a database administrator. <i>This will create the tables and indexes</i>
    <li>In includes/misc, run the seed.sql file that matches your database type.  <i>This will generate the Admin and Guest login, as well as some default system settings</i> 
  </ul>

  <p><span class="bigBold">zenTrack should now Run!</span></p>

  <p><b>Login and Change Admin Password</b></p>
  <ul>

    <li>Afterwards, visit the Admin section and configure zenTrack to your specific needs.
